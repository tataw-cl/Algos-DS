### Popular algorithms in C
The aim of this is to implement (using C programing language) as many basic DSA studied concepts so as to see working, real and modifiable versions of it.
Feel free to add any of your choice and send in a pull request accordingly.
Blow me away with your code and let's crack these stuff together <h5 one line of code at a time/>........

Have just started adding some basic fun programs like the pattern program and the digit divider programs in C, along with some fundamental concept programs like some recursive programs which are pretty interesting and should be looked upon if one is a beginner in C programing language and some of the concepts.

Also, integrating the use of LLMs like `Monica`, `poe` and `GitHub copilot` in my programing process. Did that with the linked list C code implementation.
