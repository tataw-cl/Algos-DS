The aim of this is to implement (using C programing language) as many basic DSA studied concepts so as to see working, real and modifiable versions of it...
Feel free to add any of your choice and send in a pull request accordingly.
Blow me away with your code and let's crack these stuff together <h5 one line of code at a time/>...

Have just started adding some basic fun programs like the pattern program and the digit divider programs in C, along wigh some fundamental concept programs such likee recusive programs.

Will push code for linked list implementation 

Also, integrating the use of LLMs like `Monica`, `poe` and `GitHub copilot` in my programing process...
